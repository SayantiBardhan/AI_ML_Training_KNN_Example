# AI_ML_Training_KNN_Example

This is a KNN example discussed on 16th February during AI / ML training session. Here we show KNN model output with two different weights: uniform & distance.

To run this program:
Dependencies: python, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.

You can check the difference plots obtained by changing the values of k.
